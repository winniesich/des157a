                <h3>Usability Report</h3>
                <div class="journalBlock">
                    <!-- <h2 class="journalOne">UI/UX</h2> -->
                    <p class="journalOne">I tested my prototype that I created on Figma with two college undergraduate students. One of them is a female third year design and psychology double major student, and the second is a male fourth year economic major and japanese minor student. Their names are omitted per request for privacy reasons. The third year student does not frequently play games while the fourth year student does. They both fit into my target audience because this project was created to cater towards both male and female audiences with a broad age group.</p>

                    <h2 class="journalOne">Introduction</h2>
                    <h2 class="subheaders">Summary of Key Findings</h2>
                    <p class="journalOne">Two key findings from the usability testing were testers commented how the option to refer back to the instructions were useful and the speed at which it switches players is too fast, and it makes it hard to read the text before it switches.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheadersMid">Tasks</h2>
                    <p class="journalOne">The first task that the users were given is to start the game, but to pause before actually playing. The goal of this is to let me know which type of players they were and to understand whether they are first time players or not. My project, before starting the game, asks players a simple question of “Are you a new player?,” and depending on the option, they get shown the instructions first.</p>
                    <p class="journalOne">The second task is to play the game and refer back to the instructions. The goal of this task is to see if the players could easily find the instructions again after starting the game.</p>
                    <p class="journalOne">The last task is to restart the game after the “Black Cat” turn. This task is to understand whether or not the pause button on the top right is intuitive enough for them to find where the restart is.</p>

                    <h2 class="journalOne">Results</h2>
                    <h2 class="subheaders">Bugs</h2>
                    <p class="journalOne">One bug noticed was that players weren't able to close the Game Pause menu.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheadersMid">Usability Problems</h2>
                    <p class="journalOne">When switching between the players, it goes too fast and it gets hard to read the text because it disappears quickly. </p>
                    <p class="journalOne">The scoreboard is hard to read because the font is too small, especially for the points. There isn't an emphasis on the points since “score” is a lot bigger and has the same font weight.</p>
                    <p class="journalOne">Not knowing how to exit the “Game Paused” screen since there isn't a button that lets them click “x”.</p>
