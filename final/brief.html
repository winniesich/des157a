                    <h2 class="journalOne">Project Summary</h2>
                    <p class="journalOne">For the final project, I plan to work on the Game On! project, improving its visual design and UI/UX.</p>

                    <h2 class="journalOne">Project Description</h2>
                    <p class="journalOne">Currently, my project has five main cat imagesâ€”one in the main menu, two during the game, and two in the final screen where it displays which cat won. For visual design, I plan to improve the graphics that are currently used. I want to make the images not static and have them possibly animate and give them a little bit of life. I also want to improve the graphics of when users interact with the game, such as adding a cute graphic next to the button instead of making it change colors.</p> 
                    <p class="journalOne">For the UI/UX, one aspect that I want to improve is its readability. The background of a crumpled paper has some parts where the shadow is really dark, and it makes it hard for text that is black to be seen and read when it is over those parts. I also want to improve the UI for the scoreboard. I want to make it a proper scoreboard and not just a line of text to enhance the experience.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="journalOne">Expert Feedback</h2>
                    <p class="journalOne">For expert feedback on visual design, I plan to share it with our TA and also one other designer from the industry. I haven't decided who yet. For usability testing, I plan to test it with 2 people. One doesn't have any design experience, and one does, but both are within the targeted audience. </p>
