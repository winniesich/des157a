                <h2 class="journalOne">Overlays Design Pattern</h2>

                <p class="journalOne">In “<a class="journalOne" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>,” Gonchar discussed ways people could analyze photos in order to teach important skills such as critical thinking, close reading, and visual thinking skills. I find that this method discussed was a good idea in learning how to analyze a picture through noticing small details and making connections with what is shown to you.</p>

                <p class="journalOne">Moreover, I find it intriguing how teachers could use this in their classrooms and have every student make their own comments based on their analysis and share it with the class. Being able to discuss this in a group setting would help others view ideas in a different way that they have not been able to discuss. I wish this type of method of teaching close reading and building your visual thinking skills was done when I was back in high school.</p>

                <h2 class="journalOne">Overlays Design Pattern</h2>

                <p class="journalOne">In “<a class="journalOne" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a>,” I learned that the usage of overlays are overused and can be detrimental to the user experience when poorly implemented. In order to determine whether the use of overlays are appropriate, designers/developers should consider the five W's - Who, What, When, Where and Why.</p>

                <p class="journalOne">The five W's — Who, What, When, Where and Why is a method to help determine whether a design should include overlays. Who helps determine who the target audience is. What is “what action is the user supposed to take?” When is “when will the overlay appear, and will it be an interruption?” Where is “where will the overlay appear on the page?” Why is “why does this need to be an overlay instead of within a page?” Asking yourself these five essential questions will help you determine the need of whether or not an overlay should be used or not.</p>

                <h2 class="journalOne">Best Practices for Form Design</h2>

                <p class="journalOne">In “<a class="journalOne" href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>,” I learned that designing a simple, intuitive form is vital in keeping users happy when filling them out. This article discusses 20 best practices that help with a form's usability.</p>

                <p class="journalOne">One practice that stood out to me that was discussed in this article was placeholder texts. The purpose of placeholder texts are to guide users through the process of filling out a form. They tell the users what kind of information would be inputted into the field. This was what I learned about placeholder texts, and I thought that placeholder texts always boosted usability.</p>

                <p class="journalOne"> However, placeholder texts could do the opposite. If the placeholder text is placed within the text field, the text would disappear as the user types into it, lowering its usability. Therefore, instead of having placeholder texts within the text field, these hints could instead be placed right under the text field where it would show constantly.</p>

                <p class="journalOne">A website form that I have interacted with that exemplifies best practices is Discord's “Create an account” form. As you click on fields that need a bit more information, such as “Display name” or “Username”, the form provides the users with a brief description of what that field is for.</p>
