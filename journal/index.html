            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-10-16">October 16, 2023</time>
            <p>In“ <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>,” I learned that designing a simple, intuitive form is vital in keeping users happy when filling them out. This article discusses 20 best practices that help with a form's usability.</p>
            <p>One practice that stood out to me that was discussed in this article was placeholder texts. The purpose of placeholder texts are to guide users through the process of filling out a form. They tell the users what kind of information would be inputted into the field. This was what I learned about placeholder texts, and I thought that placeholder texts always boosted usability.</p>
            <p> However, placeholder texts could do the opposite. If the placeholder text is placed within the text field, the text would disappear as the user types into it, lowering its usability. Therefore, instead of having placeholder texts within the text field, these hints could instead be placed right under the text field where it would show constantly. 
            </p>
            <p>A website form that I have interacted with that exemplifies best practices is Discord's “Create an account” form. As you click on fields that need a bit more information, such as “Display name” or “Username”, the form provides the users with a brief description of what that field is for. </p>
